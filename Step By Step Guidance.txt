Hello myself, Ajay Gandhi
As a student of coding ninja I'm doing her skill test project for react. And my project name is album list With react.

The project requirements are fetch and show all albums from API given by company.
Add an album, with post request Call on the same url,
Update the album by making put request and delete the album with making a delete request for the same url

So here my project is ready

I'm using here some dependencies, like react-loader-spinner, react-toastify, redux-persist, redux, @reduxjs/toolkit

For State Management I'm using here react toolkit.

So in album toolkit component I'm creating createsslice for album here, describing all the extraReducers for making my asynchronous call with URL

All the functions and state management also getting current value by using selectors all day features work in this AlbumToolkit component

According to the requirement I am managing state by defining initial state with value of allalbums, activeAlbum, newAlbumForm and errorMessage.

For state management I'm using a redux so creating a store for my application.

I'm using here three components one is AddAlbumComponent, second is AlbumListComponent and NavbarComponent.

For getting the value from my form input I am using here useRef hook
